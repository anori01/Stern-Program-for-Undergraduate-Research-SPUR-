# Stern-Program-for-Undergraduate-Research-SPUR-
Founded in spring 2012, the Stern Program for Undergraduate Research (SPUR) database connects NYU Stern students with world-renowned Stern faculty, providing a unique research opportunity outside of the classroom. The experience sharpens studentsâ€™ analytic skills and helps them in their future studies and careers. Besides being exposed to cutting edge research and working with individual faculty members, SPUR allows students to explore potential career pathways in academia and gain an advantage when applying for graduate studies. As of spring 2015, several SPUR students have gone on to pursue academia, having been accepted to PhD programs in Finance, Economics, Accounting, and Bio-Statistics at institutions such as Columbia, Chicago, MIT, Stanford, Johns Hopkins, and Yale.
